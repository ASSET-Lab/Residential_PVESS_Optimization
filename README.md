# Optimization Python Script
Optimization model for battery dispatch in a single direction grid connected residential solar system.
The Optimization Python Script is a joint optimization model for battery dispatch in a single-directional grid connected solar
system, aiming to minimize grid spending over a specified time period. Specifically, the code will utilize
multi processing and Pyomo to run more than one case at once, simultaneously.
Featuring:
● optimization through the Pyomo optimization tool
● multi processing technique using the joblib library; enhancing the machine’s ability to run more
than one optimization at once, increasing efficiency and speed
● user interface, allowing them to define the parameter combination for each case, creating a more
robust code
● file output in CSV file format, helping the user to identify and analyze case differentiability
